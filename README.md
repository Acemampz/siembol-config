# siembol-config

To get started with Siembol, you'll need a couple of things.  Among them, you'll need a repo like this one to store the configuration for Siembol over time.  

You can either use one repository for the whole shebang, or you can set up separate repositories for each service and even use separate repositories to differentiate betweenthe store and the release configs.

To try siembol demo please fork this repository and follow the [siembol quick start guide](https://github.com/G-Research/siembol/blob/master/docs/introduction/how-tos/quickstart.md)
